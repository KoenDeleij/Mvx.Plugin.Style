Was he being devoured by one of those secret rages, all the more terrible because contained, and which only burst forth, with an irresistible force, at the last moment? No one could tell. There he sat, calmly waitingâ€”for what? Did he still cherish hope? Did he still believe, now that the door of this prison was closed upon him, that he would succeed?";
